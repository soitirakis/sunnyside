## My process
- Mobile-first workflow 
- Started from top to bottom: header, nav, main, aside, footer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for the Menu Icon

### What I learned
Through this project I was able to review some of the CSS Flexbox and Grid procedures. 
I have had reviewed the flow procedures. Getting the right section in it's right position. 
I have become more confortable with Modal Navbar usign Javascript.  

### Continued development
The next chapter would be to implement a modal gallery for the gallery section of the webpage. So, if 
you click on an image, the image will expand to fullscreen, with a small caption beneath. Probably it 
will be implemented using the same modal principal as for the nav collapse.
